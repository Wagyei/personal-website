For milestone 2, you will design the information architecture for all the pages your website.

You may change your homepage content based on your card sorting. If you do change the homepage content, don't update it above, just include the new plan in the section below (Content Organization).

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)

> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration.
> Please physically sort cards; please don't try and do this digitally.
![card sorting](images/../../images/example1.jpg)

This was my first card sorting, I will use the home page as a welcome page, making your home page friendly will make it a welcoming environment for my audience. I will have four webages.

![card sorting](images/../../images/example2.jpg)

This is my final card sorting. I will make the home home page comprehensive with the information i think will be relevant to my audience, this is to make sure that i satisfy the goals of my audience. the other two pages resume and about will have information that I think may be optional to my audience.


### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?
The final card sorting.
> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.
I choose the final card sorting because my audience are mostly busy and will not have all the time to explore all the webpages before getting the relevant information they need. hence, presenting the most relevant information on the home page will be a good idea to meet their goals. If you

### Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.
  Home
  About
  Resume

Why I Changed the Webpages to 3.
In the first milestone, I had 4 webpages but I decided to make it 3 because I think I don't really need a webpage for contacts for my audience. with my area of mastery on my homepage, future employers can know my worth and connect with me faster, they are mostly busy so I think this will save them some time

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience.
The names are clear and informative, it will direct my audience to the webpages they wish to explore easily.
I think the name of website should not confuse your audeience but rather direct them to navigate through the site efficiently.

## Visual Themes (Milestone 3)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

Remember to focus on the things we can't see just by looking at the site: changes, alternatives considered, processes, and justifications.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (2-4 sentences).

### Theme Ideas (Milestone 3)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences.
I want my website to be formal website because the fits my intended audience.

1.The background color will be black and the text will be white for visibility. The border around the images will be a square to communicate the feeling of genunity. I will use normal font types and bold font accordingly. I will center my logo on top of the webpages.

2.The background colour will be white and the text color will beblack and orange, I prefer these two colours because they will make the content visible. I will  left align my the elements on the pages.

3 I will use gray as my background colour, I will center all the element on the pages with the exception of of my logo, h1 elements and the navigation bar. I will add a welcome image to my home page.

### Final Theme (Milestone 3)
> Which theme did you select as your final theme? Why?
I chose the last theme for my website because, I think gray is more appropriate, black is too dim and white may end up hurting the eye when the user view the page for a long period of time. I decided to use contrasting colours to make the site more readable and my user will be drawn into the content immediately they visit my website.I added a welcome image wto make the site welcoming to my audience.


### Theme Rationale (Milestone 3)
> Discuss your final theme design: how do they fit your overall design goals and audiences?
My overall goal was to keep my website formal because of my targeted audience. My final design theme will fit the overall goals and the goals for my audience because I used the appropraite color for the background to make the content readable.
> Emotion is a big part of design. What emotions were you thinking about or trying to convey in your designs?
I was thinking about implementing an emotion of serious and authenticity on my website. I want my audience to feel that I am a serious person who will be dedicated and committed to the job when they work with me.I added a welcome image to the homepage because I want to communicate a feeling that I am welcoming and a friendly person.

You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.
It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section runs a few paragraphs (1-2). Sketches can often help tell the story of your design. Screenshots are also useful for describing issues discovered during the design process and how you addressed them.
